Transfer Entropy Summary
-------------------------
Parameters: history length k=1, delay tau=1

Average TE (bits):
- activity_level -> label:SITTING: 0.0035 +/- 0.0000 (n=1)
- label:SITTING -> activity_level: 0.0018 +/- 0.0000 (n=1)

Interpretation:
The average TE from activity level to sitting state is greater than the reverse direction,
suggesting how reliably motion signals anticipate posture changes.
This insight helps product teams reason about moments like a candidate PM spotting a
 user's upcoming focus period (e.g., sitting still before a meeting) and timing 'do not
 disturb' nudges or proactive assistance.
